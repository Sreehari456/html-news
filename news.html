	<h3><i>Argentina has won the 2022 World Cup in Lusail, Qatar, defeating France with a 3-3 (4-2 penalty) final score after a nail-bitting match that concluded in a penalty shootout.</i></h3>

	<p style="font-family: sans-serif">The first half of the match saw Argentina claim a 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Angel Di Maria and the legendary Lionel Messi, who played his final World Cup today. With a penalty kick 23 minutes in, <b>messi</b> became the first man in FIFA World Cup history to score in all five rounds at a single tournament. </p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Progressing into the second half, Argentina looked to secure their lead (and avoid exhausting their players) by slowing down their play—but France soon rallied to a tie with two consecutive goals from <b>kylian mbappe</b>, the team’s 23-year-old star player.</p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">During extra time, Messi scored for Argentina yet again, bringing the score to 3-2, before Mbappé pulled off a hat trick, forcing a tie-breaking shootout at 3-3. While Mbappé and Randal Kolo Muani went on to convert their penalties for France, misses from Kingsley Coman and Aurelien Tchouameni cleared the way for an Argentine win, after Messi, Paulo Dybala, Leandro Paredes, and finally 25-year-old Gonzalo Montiel all found the back of the net, clinching the match. </p><br><br>

	<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Both teams today were up for their third World Cup; France has worn the Cup twice, in 1998 and 2018, while Argentina won in 1978 and 1986. </p>

	<p style="font-family: sans-serif">Messi has been a man on a mission in the Middle East, determined to erase memories of his only other World Cup final — in 2014 when Argentina lost to Germany 1-0 and Messi squandered a great chance in the second half.

On that night at the Maracana Stadium, Messi stared down at that golden World Cup trophy that escaped him.

Eight years later, he raised it aloft in the biggest moment of a career like no other. </p><br><br>
